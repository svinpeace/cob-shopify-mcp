# Custom YAML Tools Guide

Add any Shopify Admin GraphQL API operation as a tool — no TypeScript, no rebuild.

## Quick Start

1. Write a `.yaml` file in this directory
2. Set `COB_SHOPIFY_CUSTOM_TOOLS=./custom-tools` in your `.env` (or config)
3. Restart the server — tool is live

## YAML Tool Structure

```yaml
name: my_tool_name              # Unique tool name (snake_case)
domain: orders                   # Domain: products, orders, customers, inventory, analytics
description: What this tool does # Clear description for AI agents
scopes:                          # Required Shopify API scopes (see scopes section below)
  - read_orders
  - read_products
input:                           # Input parameters
  order_id:
    type: string                 # string, number, boolean, enum
    description: The order GID
    required: true               # true = mandatory, false/omit = optional
  limit:
    type: number
    description: Max results
    required: false
    min: 1                       # number validation
    max: 250
    default: 10                  # default value if not provided
  status:
    type: enum                   # enum = dropdown/fixed values
    description: Filter by status
    required: false
    enum:                        # list all valid values
      - ACTIVE
      - DRAFT
      - ARCHIVED
graphql: |                       # The GraphQL query or mutation
  query MyQuery($order_id: ID!, $limit: Int) {
    order(id: $order_id) {
      id
      name
      lineItems(first: $limit) {
        edges {
          node { title quantity }
        }
      }
    }
  }
response:                        # Optional response mapping
  mapping: data.order            # Dot-path to extract from response
```

## Important Rules

### 1. Variable names must match exactly

Your `input` field names become GraphQL variables. They must match the `$variable` names in your GraphQL query.

```yaml
# Input field name = GraphQL variable name
input:
  order_id:        # → $order_id in GraphQL
    type: string

graphql: |
  query($order_id: ID!) {      # Must match input field name
    order(id: $order_id) { ... }
  }
```

### 2. Response mapping path

The Shopify client returns `{ data: { ... }, cost: { ... } }`. Your mapping must start with `data.`:

```yaml
# For a query that returns order data:
response:
  mapping: data.order              # Extracts response.data.order

# For a mutation:
response:
  mapping: data.draftOrderComplete # Extracts response.data.draftOrderComplete

# No mapping = returns the full raw response (data + cost)
```

### 3. Mutations vs Queries

**Queries** (read operations) — use `query` keyword:
```yaml
graphql: |
  query GetProduct($id: ID!) {
    product(id: $id) { id title }
  }
```

**Mutations** (write operations) — use `mutation` keyword:
```yaml
graphql: |
  mutation UpdateProduct($input: ProductInput!) {
    productUpdate(input: $input) {
      product { id title }
      userErrors { field message }
    }
  }
```

### 4. Always include userErrors for mutations

Shopify mutations return `userErrors`. Always include them in your GraphQL:

```yaml
graphql: |
  mutation DoSomething($input: SomeInput!) {
    someMutation(input: $input) {
      result { id }
      userErrors {    # Always include this
        field
        message
      }
    }
  }
```

### 5. Shopify GID format

Shopify uses Global IDs like `gid://shopify/Product/12345`. Always document this in your input description:

```yaml
input:
  id:
    type: string
    description: Product GID (e.g. gid://shopify/Product/12345)
    required: true
```

### 6. Pagination with edges/nodes

Shopify GraphQL uses the Relay connection pattern. Lists return `edges > node`:

```yaml
graphql: |
  query ListProducts($limit: Int) {
    products(first: $limit) {
      edges {
        node {
          id
          title
        }
      }
      pageInfo {
        hasNextPage
        endCursor
      }
    }
  }
```

## How to Find GraphQL Queries

1. Go to **Shopify GraphQL Admin API docs**: https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql
2. Search for the operation you need (e.g., "productCreate", "orderCancel")
3. Check the **Arguments** section for required input types
4. Check the **Return fields** section for what you can query
5. Use the **GraphiQL explorer** on your dev store: `https://your-store.myshopify.com/admin/api/2026-01/graphql.json`

### Using Shopify's GraphiQL Explorer

1. Open your store admin: `https://your-store.myshopify.com/admin`
2. Go to Settings → Apps and sales channels → Develop apps
3. Or use the direct URL: `https://your-store.myshopify.com/admin/api/2026-01/graphql.json`
4. Test your query there first, then copy it into your YAML file

## Scopes Reference

### Recommended Scopes for Full Access

Paste this into your app's scopes field on dev.shopify.com:

```
read_products, write_products, read_orders, write_orders, read_all_orders, read_draft_orders, write_draft_orders, read_order_edits, write_order_edits, read_customers, write_customers, read_inventory, write_inventory, read_locations, read_fulfillments, write_fulfillments, read_assigned_fulfillment_orders, write_assigned_fulfillment_orders, read_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders, write_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders, read_third_party_fulfillment_orders, write_third_party_fulfillment_orders, read_shipping, read_reports, read_legal_policies
```

### Read-Only Scopes

If you only want read access (set `COB_SHOPIFY_READ_ONLY=true`):

```
read_products, read_orders, read_all_orders, read_draft_orders, read_customers, read_inventory, read_locations, read_fulfillments, read_assigned_fulfillment_orders, read_merchant_managed_fulfillment_orders, read_third_party_fulfillment_orders, read_shipping, read_reports, read_legal_policies
```

## Error Handling

### Scope Errors

If your tool fails with "Access denied", it means your app is missing a required scope. The server will tell you:

```
Access denied — your app is missing required Shopify scopes.
Go to dev.shopify.com → your app → Configuration → update scopes → Release a new version.
Then reinstall the app on your store.
```

**Fix:** Add the missing scope on dev.shopify.com, release a new version, reinstall the app on your store.

### GraphQL Errors

If your GraphQL query has a syntax error, you'll see:

```
GraphQL errors: Field 'xyz' doesn't exist on type 'Product'
```

**Fix:** Check the Shopify GraphQL docs for the correct field names. Test your query in GraphiQL first.

### Variable Mismatch

If your input field names don't match the GraphQL variable names:

```
GraphQL errors: Variable $wrong_name is not defined
```

**Fix:** Make sure your `input` field names exactly match the `$variable` names in your `graphql` query.

## Example: Adding a Custom Tool Step by Step

Let's say you want a tool to get a product's metafields.

**Step 1:** Find the query in Shopify docs → https://shopify.dev/docs/api/admin-graphql/2026-01/queries/product

**Step 2:** Write the YAML:

```yaml
name: get_product_metafields
domain: products
description: Get all metafields for a product by its GID
scopes:
  - read_products
  - read_metaobjects
input:
  product_id:
    type: string
    description: Product GID (e.g. gid://shopify/Product/12345)
    required: true
  namespace:
    type: string
    description: Filter by metafield namespace
    required: false
graphql: |
  query GetProductMetafields($product_id: ID!, $namespace: String) {
    product(id: $product_id) {
      id
      title
      metafields(first: 50, namespace: $namespace) {
        edges {
          node {
            id
            namespace
            key
            value
            type
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
response:
  mapping: data.product
```

**Step 3:** Save as `custom-tools/get-product-metafields.yaml`

**Step 4:** Restart the server. Done — tool is live.

## Enabling / Disabling Tools

### Via environment variables:

```env
# Disable specific tools (comma-separated)
COB_SHOPIFY_DISABLE=cancel_order,create_fulfillment

# Enable only specific Tier 2 tools
COB_SHOPIFY_ENABLE=some_tier2_tool

# Disable ALL write operations
COB_SHOPIFY_READ_ONLY=true
```

### Via config file (cob-shopify-mcp.yaml):

```yaml
tools:
  read_only: false
  disable:
    - cancel_order
    - create_fulfillment
  enable:
    - some_tier2_tool
  custom_paths:
    - ./custom-tools
    - /opt/my-other-tools
```

### Tier system:

- **Tier 1** — Built-in tools, enabled by default (49 tools)
- **Tier 2** — Built-in but disabled by default (sensitive operations, opt-in)
- **Tier 3** — Custom YAML tools, enabled by default

### Priority: `read_only` > `disable` > `enable` > tier defaults
